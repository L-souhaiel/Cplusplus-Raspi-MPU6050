# MPU6050
A C++ module for accessing the MPU-6050 digital accelerometer and gyroscope on a Raspberry Pi.

# Example
Assuming that the address of your MPU-6050 is 0x68, you can read read accelerometer data from Test.cpp like this:

acceleration in x_achse : ...g.
acceleration in y_achse : ...g.
acceleration in z_achse : ...g.

Temperature : ...C

Rotation by x_achse : ...deg/s.
Rotation by y_achse : ...deg/s. 
Rotation by z_achse : ...deg/s.

by Accelerometer  ==> Rotation Angle by the X achse : .... deg.
by Accelerometer  ==> Rotation Angle by the Y achse : .... deg.
by Accelerometer  ==> Rotation Angle by the Z achse : .... deg.
